# Insurance Risk Analysis and A/B Hypothesis Testing

This project analyzes insurance data to evaluate the impact of various features on risk and profit margin differences. It includes A/B hypothesis testing to evaluate the effects of features such as cover category, province, postal code, and gender on the risk and profit margin for insurance policies.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into the following key components:

- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the insurance data for analysis.
- **A/B Hypothesis Testing**: Statistical tests to evaluate hypotheses about risk and profit margin differences.
- **Segmentation**: Dividing the data into control and test groups for analysis.
- **Statistical Modeling**: Diving into the model evaluation.
  
### Files

- **scripts/task3.py**: Contains the implementation of A/B hypothesis testing for the project.
- **notebooks/insurance_data.csv**: The historical insurance data used for analysis (Feb 2014 - Aug 2015), Statisitical_modeling.ipynb: which evaluates different models.
- **requirements.txt**: A list of dependencies for running the project.

## Requirements

This project requires Python 3.11 or higher, along with the following libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- scipy
- dvc (for version control of data)

You can install the required dependencies using `pip` by running:
